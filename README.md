CAN-ML dataset (Danish) can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/brooke-lampe/can-ml/src/master/ 

Car Hacking Dataset (Korean) can be found here: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset

The "CAN_Car_Hacking_CNN_LSTM.ipynb" uses a modified version of Car Hacking Dataset.
I only have the normal sequences generated. Can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwAe06Fblr5ZVrreEc1ZxKnLbD_-MueD/view?usp=sharing


I have included the subaru forester dbc for decoding CAN messages.
